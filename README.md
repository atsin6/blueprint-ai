# Blueprint AI

Blueprint AI is a deterministic AI-driven backend system designed to convert natural language intent into structured UI blueprints. The project focuses on building a controlled agent-based pipeline using **Spring Boot**, where each stage transforms user input into predictable and validated UI definitions rather than generating uncontrolled output.

## Overview

Modern AI systems often produce inconsistent or non-deterministic results. Blueprint AI explores a different approach by combining traditional backend architecture with structured AI orchestration. Instead of directly generating interfaces, the system analyzes intent, applies rule-based processing, and produces standardized UI specifications that can later be rendered by a frontend.

This repository contains the backend implementation responsible for:

* Processing user intent requests
* Managing agent workflows
* Structuring UI definitions
* Maintaining deterministic behavior within an AI pipeline

## Tech Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot
* Maven
* REST APIs
* Agent-based architecture (LLM-assisted pipeline)

## Project Goals

* Build a scalable AI UI generation backend
* Maintain predictable and testable system behavior
* Separate AI reasoning from application logic
* Provide a strong architectural foundation for future frontend integration

## Status

This project is currently under active development as part of an AI systems assignment focused on architecture design, backend engineering, and controlled AI integration.
